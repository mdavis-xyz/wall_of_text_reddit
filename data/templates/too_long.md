Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/wall_of_text_reddit/tree/master).

It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.
This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.

It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs?

I'm a bot. If you don't like me, or I'm not working properly, downvote this post.
If the post gets downvoted to a negative value, it will be deleted and the developer will take note.
