Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/wall_of_text_reddit/tree/master).

It seems I've made a mistake. (This post was downvoted below zero.)

Disregard this post. Hopefully my owner will train me to be better in the future.

~~It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.
This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.~~

~~It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs?~~
