Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/wall_of_text_reddit/tree/master).

You originally posted a huge wall of text.
Since then, you have edited that to split it up into smaller paragraphs.
Thank you. 
That change has made this subreddit a nicer place to browse.
Hopefully more people will read and reply to this nicer revision.

~~It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.~~
~~This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.~~

~~It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs?~~

I'm a bot. If you don't like me, or I'm not working properly, downvote this post.
If the post gets downvoted to a negative value, it will be deleted and the developer will take note.
